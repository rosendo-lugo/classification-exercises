    - The petal width and length don't have a normal distribution. 
    - All three species have the same frequency of 30.

- By looking at the scatter plot comparing sepal length and petal length, we can see that the setosa species tends to have shorter petals and sepals, while the virginica species tends to have longer petals and sepals. The versicolor species falls in between the two.

- The takeaway from this analysis is that the different iris species have distinct patterns in their measurements that allow us to distinguish them from each other. Additionally, we found a significant difference in sepal area between the virginica and setosa species. This information could be useful in identifying and classifying iris species.


From the multivariate analysis, we can see that there are distinct patterns in the measurements that separate the three different species of iris. We can also see how each measurement type interacts with the others using a pairplot.

By looking at the scatter plot comparing sepal length and petal length, we can see that the setosa species tends to have shorter petals and sepals, while the virginica species tends to have longer petals and sepals. The versicolor species falls in between the two.

We then asked the specific question of whether the sepal area was significantly different between the virginica and setosa species. We calculated the sepal area for each species and performed a Mann-Whitney U test, which showed a significant difference in sepal area between the two species. We also visualized the difference using a box plot, which clearly shows the difference in sepal area between the two species.

The takeaway from this analysis is that the different iris species have distinct patterns in their measurements that allow us to distinguish them from each other. Additionally, we found a significant difference in sepal area between the virginica and setosa species. This information could be useful in identifying and classifying iris species.

Sure! The boxplot shows us that there is a clear difference in the sepal area between virginica and setosa. The median sepal area for virginica is much higher than that of setosa. Additionally, the interquartile range (IQR) for virginica is much wider than that of setosa, indicating that there is more variability in sepal area for virginica. Finally, there are several outliers for virginica, which are data points that fall outside of the whiskers of the boxplot. These outliers suggest that there may be some extreme values in the virginica data that are contributing to the wider IQR. Overall, the boxplot provides strong evidence that the sepal area is significantly different between virginica and setosa, which is supported by the results of the Mann-Whitney test.

Based on the boxplot and the Mann-Whitney U test result, we can conclude that the sepal area of virginica is significantly larger than that of setosa. The boxplot shows that the median sepal area of virginica is higher than that of setosa, and the Mann-Whitney U test confirms that the difference in sepal area between the two species is statistically significant. Therefore, we can say that on average, the sepal area of virginica is bigger than that of setosa.
